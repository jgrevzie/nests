reset_db should not be true by default
remove precompile of assets?
maybe get rid of crazy initialization code in fabricators (could try model options to auto-generate or ! option in Fabrication)
move after_build! out of CompletedProc in completed_proc_fabricator.rb
Array.new(50) {fabricate.cp.call} .call could be replaced because it may be possible to pass a block in directly
reset_db: false could be replaced by something that doesn't load procs?
Shouldn't load the procedures from CathLab during test, should perhaps have special test spreadsheet of procedures
Nurse.count.should eq 5 not pretty in spreadsheet loader spec
